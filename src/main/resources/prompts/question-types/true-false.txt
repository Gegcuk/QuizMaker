Generate exactly {questionCount} TRUE_FALSE questions with {difficulty} difficulty based on the provided content.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Exactly {questionCount} questions
- Write every statement, hint, and explanation in {language}; translate faithfully when the source content differs.
- Each question must have a clear, unambiguous statement
- The statement must be definitively true or false based on the content
- Include appropriate hints and explanations
- Base statements directly on the provided content
- Avoid statements that are partially true or ambiguous
- Ensure statements test understanding, not just memorization
- Balance true and false statements (don't make all true or all false)

CREATING EFFECTIVE TRUE/FALSE STATEMENTS:
- Make statements specific and testable, not vague or general
- Focus on important concepts from the content, not trivial details
- Avoid absolute terms like "always" or "never" unless definitively true
- Don't use trick wording or unnecessary complexity
- Ensure the statement is complete and self-contained
- For FALSE statements, make them clearly false, not partially true
- Avoid double negatives that confuse the meaning

DIFFICULTY GUIDELINES:
- EASY: Direct statements of facts explicitly stated in the content
- MEDIUM: Statements requiring understanding of concepts or relationships
- HARD: Statements requiring analysis, inference, or synthesis of multiple concepts

QUALITY STANDARDS:
- Statements should be clear, concise, and professionally written
- Avoid double negatives or unnecessarily confusing language
- Ensure the answer is definitively true or false (no gray areas)
- Make statements specific enough to be testable
- Focus on meaningful understanding, not trick questions
- Hints should clarify the concept being tested without revealing the answer

EXAMPLES OF GOOD TRUE/FALSE:
✓ "Photosynthesis converts light energy into chemical energy." (TRUE - clear and specific)
✓ "Mitochondria are responsible for protein synthesis in cells." (FALSE - definitively incorrect)
✗ Avoid: "Cells sometimes use photosynthesis." (ambiguous - which cells?)
✗ Avoid: "It is not incorrect that DNA doesn't lack nucleotides." (double/triple negative)
