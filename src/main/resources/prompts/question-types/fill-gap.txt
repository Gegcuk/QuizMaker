Generate exactly {questionCount} FILL_GAP questions with {difficulty} difficulty based on the provided content.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Exactly {questionCount} questions
- Write every sentence, gap text, hint, and explanation in {language}; translate faithfully when the source content differs.
- Each question should have 1-3 gaps to fill
- Gaps should be marked with exactly three underscores (___)
- Provide the correct answer for each gap
- Include appropriate hints and explanations
- Base questions directly on the provided content
- Ensure gaps test important concepts or key terms
- Make sure there is only one correct answer per gap

CREATING EFFECTIVE GAPS:
- Place gaps on key terms, important concepts, or critical values
- Ensure the surrounding context provides sufficient clues
- Gaps should test recall of specific information from the content
- Use sequential gap IDs (1, 2, 3) matching the order of appearance in text
- The sentence should read naturally when the answer fills the gap
- Avoid placing gaps on articles (a, an, the) or common words
- AVOID interchangeable gaps like "___ and ___" where answers could be swapped
- Each gap should have a unique, specific answer based on context
- If using multiple gaps, ensure they test different concepts, not similar terms

DIFFICULTY GUIDELINES:
- EASY: Key terms, names, basic facts (1-2 gaps)
- MEDIUM: Important concepts, definitions, relationships (2 gaps)
- HARD: Complex terms, specific technical details, nuanced concepts (2-3 gaps)

QUALITY STANDARDS:
- Sentences should be clear, complete, and grammatically correct
- Gaps should be placed logically and naturally within sentences
- Correct answers should be specific and unambiguous
- Avoid gaps that could have multiple valid answers (e.g., synonyms)
- Ensure the context provides enough clues without making it too obvious
- The complete sentence (with gaps filled) should flow naturally
