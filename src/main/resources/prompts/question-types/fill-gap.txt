Generate exactly {questionCount} FILL_GAP questions with {difficulty} difficulty based on the provided content.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Exactly {questionCount} questions
- Write every sentence, gap text, hint, and explanation in {language}; translate faithfully when the source content differs.
- Each question should have 1-3 gaps to fill
- Gaps should be marked with {N} where N is the gap ID (e.g., {1}, {2}, {3})
- Gap IDs must be sequential integers starting from 1
- Provide the correct answer for each gap
- Include appropriate hints and explanations
- Base questions directly on the provided content
- Ensure gaps test important concepts or key terms
- Make sure there is only one correct answer per gap

CREATING EFFECTIVE GAPS:
- Place gaps on key terms, important concepts, or critical values
- Ensure the surrounding context provides sufficient clues
- Gaps should test recall of specific information from the content
- Use sequential gap IDs (1, 2, 3) matching the order of appearance in text
- CRITICAL: Every {N} placeholder in the text MUST have a corresponding gap with id=N in the gaps array
- The sentence should read naturally when the answer fills the gap
- Avoid placing gaps on articles (a, an, the) or common words
- AVOID interchangeable gaps like "{1} and {2}" where answers could be swapped
- Each gap should have a unique, specific answer based on context
- If using multiple gaps, ensure they test different concepts, not similar terms

DIFFICULTY GUIDELINES:
- EASY: Key terms, names, basic facts (1-2 gaps)
- MEDIUM: Important concepts, definitions, relationships (2 gaps)
- HARD: Complex terms, specific technical details, nuanced concepts (2-3 gaps)

QUALITY STANDARDS:
- Sentences should be clear, complete, and grammatically correct
- Gaps should be placed logically and naturally within sentences
- Correct answers should be specific and unambiguous
- Avoid gaps that could have multiple valid answers (e.g., synonyms)
- Ensure the context provides enough clues without making it too obvious
- The complete sentence (with gaps filled) should flow naturally

EXAMPLES OF GOOD GAPS:
✓ "The process of {1} converts light energy into chemical energy in plants." 
   gaps: [{"id": 1, "answer": "photosynthesis"}]

✓ "In 1776, the {1} was signed, declaring independence from Britain." 
   gaps: [{"id": 1, "answer": "Declaration of Independence"}]

✓ "The {1} is located in the nucleus and contains genetic information." 
   gaps: [{"id": 1, "answer": "DNA"}]

✓ "Spring Framework provides {1} and {2} for Java applications."
   gaps: [{"id": 1, "answer": "dependency injection"}, {"id": 2, "answer": "inversion of control"}]

✗ Avoid: "The {1} is {2}." (too vague, multiple answers possible)
✗ Avoid: "{1} occurs in {2}." (lacks context)
✗ Avoid: "{1} and/or {2} are examples of organelles." where answers are interchangeable
✗ Avoid: "The {1} won the war in {2}." (multiple gaps with context-independent answers)
