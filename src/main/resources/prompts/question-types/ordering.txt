Generate exactly {questionCount} ORDERING questions with {difficulty} difficulty based on the provided content.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Exactly {questionCount} questions
- Write every question, item text, hint, and explanation in {language}; translate faithfully when the source content differs.
- Each question should have 3-5 items to order
- Items should be clearly related and have a logical sequence
- Include appropriate hints and explanations
- Base questions directly on the provided content
- Ensure there is only one correct order
- Make sure the ordering tests understanding of processes, sequences, or relationships

CRITICAL: LIST ITEMS IN THE CORRECT ORDER
- The items MUST be listed in the correct sequential order from start to finish
- For chronological sequences: list from earliest to latest event
- For process steps: list from first step to last step
- For cause-effect: list from cause to ultimate effect
- The system will shuffle the display order - you just provide the correct sequence
- Use sequential IDs (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) that match the correct order

EXAMPLES OF CORRECT ORDERING:
✓ Process: 1="Gather ingredients", 2="Mix dry ingredients", 3="Add wet ingredients", 4="Bake in oven", 5="Cool and serve"
✓ History: 1="Declaration of Independence (1776)", 2="Constitution ratified (1788)", 3="Bill of Rights (1791)", 4="Civil War (1861-1865)"
✓ Biology: 1="DNA replication begins", 2="Helicase unwinds DNA", 3="Primase adds primers", 4="DNA polymerase synthesizes", 5="Ligase seals gaps"

DIFFICULTY GUIDELINES:
- EASY: Simple sequences, chronological order, basic processes (3-4 steps)
- MEDIUM: Complex processes, cause-and-effect relationships, multi-step procedures (4-5 steps)
- HARD: Abstract concepts, complex relationships, multiple criteria for ordering (5 steps)

QUALITY STANDARDS:
- Items should be clearly stated and self-contained
- Each item should represent a distinct step or stage
- The correct order should be unambiguous and logical
- Avoid items that could be ordered in multiple valid ways
- Ensure the sequence tests meaningful understanding
- Provide clear context in the question text for why the order matters
- Include numbering or time markers in item text when appropriate for clarity
