Generate exactly {questionCount} MATCHING questions with {difficulty} difficulty based on the provided content.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Exactly {questionCount} questions
- Write every question, item text, hint, and explanation in {language}; translate faithfully when the source content differs.
- Provide a list of left items (prompts) and right items (matches)
- Number of items varies by difficulty (see guidelines below)
- Each left item has: id (integer), text (string), matchId (integer pointing to the correct right item)
- Each right item has: id (integer), text (string)
- Use sequential IDs for left (1, 2, 3, 4...) and distinct IDs for right (10, 20, 30, 40...)
- Ensure IDs are unique within their respective lists
- Include appropriate hints and explanations
- Base questions directly on the provided content

CREATING EFFECTIVE MATCHING QUESTIONS:
- Left items should be concepts, terms, people, dates, or causes
- Right items should be their definitions, examples, achievements, events, or effects
- All items should be related to the same general topic
- Ensure there is exactly one correct match for each left item
- Include plausible but incorrect right items as distractors
- Number of distractors varies by difficulty (see guidelines below)
- Keep item text concise and parallel in structure

DIFFICULTY GUIDELINES - ITEMS AND DISTRACTORS:
- EASY: Simple direct matches, obvious relationships
  • 4 left items + 4 right items (no distractors, 1-to-1 matching)
  • Right items should be clearly distinguishable
  • Direct, straightforward relationships
  
- MEDIUM: Conceptual matches requiring understanding
  • 4-5 left items + 4-5 right items (no distractors, 1-to-1 matching)
  • Requires understanding of concepts and relationships
  • Items are less obvious than EASY but still clearly paired
  
- HARD: Complex relationships, subtle distinctions
  • 5-6 left items + 7-9 right items (2-3 distractors)
  • Distractors should be very similar to correct answers
  • Requires deep understanding to distinguish correct matches
  • Extra right items provide plausible wrong answers

QUALITY STANDARDS:
- Matches should be clear and definitively correct
- Ensure only one correct pairing for each left item
- All items should be similar in length and complexity
- Right items should be plausible distractors for other left items
- Provide helpful context in the question text for the type of relationship
- Avoid obvious patterns (like alphabetical matching)

EXAMPLES OF GOOD MATCHING BY DIFFICULTY:

✓ EASY (4 left + 4 right, no distractors):
  Question: "Match each animal with its class:"
  Left: 1="Dog" (matchId: 10), 2="Eagle" (matchId: 20), 3="Salmon" (matchId: 30), 4="Frog" (matchId: 40)
  Right: 10="Mammal", 20="Bird", 30="Fish", 40="Amphibian"

✓ MEDIUM (4 left + 4 right, no distractors):
  Question: "Match each scientist with their major contribution:"
  Left: 1="Charles Darwin" (matchId: 10), 2="Isaac Newton" (matchId: 20), 3="Marie Curie" (matchId: 30), 4="Louis Pasteur" (matchId: 40)
  Right: 10="Theory of Evolution", 20="Laws of Motion", 30="Radioactivity research", 40="Germ theory"

✓ HARD (5 left + 8 right, 3 distractors):
  Question: "Match each programming paradigm with its primary characteristic:"
  Left: 1="Object-Oriented" (matchId: 10), 2="Functional" (matchId: 20), 3="Procedural" (matchId: 30), 4="Logic" (matchId: 40), 5="Declarative" (matchId: 50)
  Right: 10="Encapsulation and inheritance", 20="Pure functions and immutability", 30="Sequential instructions", 40="Rule-based inference", 50="What to compute, not how", 60="Event-driven callbacks", 70="Concurrent processes", 80="Data flow streams"
  
✗ Avoid: Mixing categories (e.g., matching dates with colors - unrelated concepts)
✗ Avoid: Items of vastly different lengths or complexity
✗ Avoid: Adding distractors for EASY or MEDIUM - only HARD should have them
