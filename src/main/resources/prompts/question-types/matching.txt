Generate exactly {questionCount} MATCHING questions with {difficulty} difficulty based on the provided content.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Exactly {questionCount} questions
- Write every question, item text, hint, and explanation in {language}; translate faithfully when the source content differs.
- Provide a list of left items (prompts) and right items (matches)
- Each question should have 4-6 pairs
- Each left item has: id (integer), text (string), matchId (integer pointing to the correct right item)
- Each right item has: id (integer), text (string)
- Use sequential IDs for left (1, 2, 3, 4...) and distinct IDs for right (10, 20, 30, 40...)
- Ensure IDs are unique within their respective lists
- Include appropriate hints and explanations
- Base questions directly on the provided content

CREATING EFFECTIVE MATCHING QUESTIONS:
- Left items should be concepts, terms, people, dates, or causes
- Right items should be their definitions, examples, achievements, events, or effects
- All items should be related to the same general topic
- Ensure there is exactly one correct match for each left item
- Include some plausible but incorrect right items as distractors
- Typically have 1-2 more right items than left items (e.g., 4 left + 5-6 right)
- Keep item text concise and parallel in structure

DIFFICULTY GUIDELINES:
- EASY: Simple direct matches, obvious relationships (4 pairs, few distractors)
- MEDIUM: Conceptual matches requiring understanding (4-5 pairs, moderate similarity)
- HARD: Complex relationships, subtle distinctions (5-6 pairs, similar distractors)

QUALITY STANDARDS:
- Matches should be clear and definitively correct
- Ensure only one correct pairing for each left item
- All items should be similar in length and complexity
- Right items should be plausible distractors for other left items
- Provide helpful context in the question text for the type of relationship
- Avoid obvious patterns (like alphabetical matching)

EXAMPLES OF GOOD MATCHING:
✓ Question: "Match each scientist with their major contribution:"
  Left: 1="Charles Darwin" (matchId: 10), 2="Isaac Newton" (matchId: 20), 3="Marie Curie" (matchId: 30)
  Right: 10="Theory of Evolution", 20="Laws of Motion", 30="Radioactivity research", 40="Germ theory"
  
✗ Avoid: Mixing categories (e.g., matching dates with colors - unrelated concepts)
✗ Avoid: Items of vastly different lengths or complexity
