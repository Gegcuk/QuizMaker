Return JSON with the schema shown in the format instructions. Each question must include:
- questionText: clear stem without numbering
- type: one of the supported question types (match canonical enum values)
- difficulty: EASY, MEDIUM, or HARD
- content: structured object matching the platform schema for the question type
- optional hint and explanation fields when they add value
