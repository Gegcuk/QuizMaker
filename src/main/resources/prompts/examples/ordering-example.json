      "hint": "Consider the evolution from SSL to TLS and how each version built upon the previous one's security improvements",
      "explanation": "SSL/TLS protocols evolved chronologically: SSL 2.0 was the first widely used version (1995), followed by SSL 3.0 (1996). TLS succeeded SSL, starting with TLS 1.0 (1999), then TLS 1.1 (2006), TLS 1.2 (2008), and most recently TLS 1.3 (2018). Each version addressed security concerns from the previous one."

      "hint": "Think about what happens first in the light-dependent reactions and then moves to the Calvin cycle",
      "explanation": "Photosynthesis occurs in two main stages: the light-dependent reactions (steps 1-3) where light energy is captured and used to produce ATP and NADPH, followed by the light-independent Calvin cycle (steps 4-5) where carbon dioxide is fixed and glucose is synthesized."

      "hint": "Think about the escalation from protest to political action to armed conflict to formal separation",
      "explanation": "The sequence follows the escalation of tensions: the Boston Tea Party (1773) was a protest against British taxation, which led to the First Continental Congress (1774), then to armed conflict at Lexington and Concord (1775), and finally to the formal Declaration of Independence (1776).
