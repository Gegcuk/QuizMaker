    {
      "questionText": "Evaluate whether the following data handling practice complies with GDPR",
      "difficulty": "HARD",
      "type": "COMPLIANCE",
      "content": {
        "statement": "A company stores customer email addresses indefinitely without obtaining explicit consent and uses them for marketing purposes without providing an opt-out mechanism.",
        "compliant": false
      },
      "hint": "Consider GDPR requirements for consent, data retention, and user rights",
      "explanation": "This practice violates GDPR in multiple ways: (1) explicit consent is required for marketing purposes, (2) data should not be retained indefinitely without justification, and (3) users must have the ability to opt-out of marketing communications. GDPR requires lawful basis for processing, data minimization, and respect for user rights."

      "questionText": "Evaluate this password policy for security compliance",
      "difficulty": "MEDIUM",
      "type": "COMPLIANCE",
      "content": {
        "statement": "Passwords must be at least 12 characters long, contain uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters, and must be changed every 90 days.",
        "compliant": true
      },
      "hint": "Consider modern password security best practices like NIST guidelines",
      "explanation": "This policy is compliant with most security standards. It enforces strong password complexity (12+ characters with mixed character types) and regular rotation. While some modern guidance suggests password rotation may not always be necessary, a 90-day rotation is still considered acceptable for high-security environments."
