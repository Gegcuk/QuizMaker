      "questionText": "Evaluate whether the following data handling practice complies with GDPR",
      "difficulty": "HARD",
      "type": "COMPLIANCE",
      "content": {
        "statements": [
          {
            "id": 1,
            "text": "A company stores customer email addresses indefinitely without obtaining explicit consent and uses them for marketing purposes without providing an opt-out mechanism.",
            "compliant": false
          },
          {
            "id": 2,
            "text": "The company provides clear opt-in checkboxes for marketing emails and allows users to unsubscribe at any time.",
            "compliant": true
          }
        ]
      },
      "hint": "Consider GDPR requirements for consent, data retention, and user rights",
      "explanation": "This practice violates GDPR in multiple ways: (1) explicit consent is required for marketing purposes, (2) data should not be retained indefinitely without justification, and (3) users must have the ability to opt-out of marketing communications. GDPR requires lawful basis for processing, data minimization, and respect for user rights."

      "type": "COMPLIANCE",
      "content": {
        "statements": [
          {
            "id": 1,
            "text": "Passwords must be at least 12 characters long with mixed character types",

            "compliant": false
          }
        ]
      },
      "hint": "Consider modern password security best practices like NIST guidelines",
      "explanation": "This policy is compliant with most security standards. It enforces strong password complexity (12+ characters with mixed character types) and regular rotation. While some modern guidance suggests password rotation may not always be necessary, a 90-day rotation is still considered acceptable for high-security environments."
