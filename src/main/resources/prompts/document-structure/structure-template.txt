**DOCUMENT CONTENT**
{content}

**GENERATION PARAMETERS**

* Profile: {profile}
* Granularity: {granularity}
* Document Length: {charCount} characters

**TASK**
Produce a **DocumentStructureResponse** JSON object:

```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "type": "SECTION|SUBSECTION|PARAGRAPH|CHAPTER|BOOK|UTTERANCE|OTHER",
      "title": "Descriptive title",
      "start_anchor": "First 20–120 chars of this section, verbatim, unique, NFC",
      "end_anchor": "Last 20–120 chars of this section, verbatim, unique, NFC",
      "depth": 0,
      "confidence": 0.95
    }
  ]
}
```

**REQUIREMENTS**

* Anchors **must be inside the section they describe**; never reference the next section's heading as `end_anchor`.
* Anchors **≥20 chars**, unique, verbatim, NFC-normalized.
* Nodes ordered by document position; siblings do **not** overlap; parent spans contain all children.
* Depth typically changes by **±1** between adjacent nodes.
* Types reflect content and the specified profile/granularity.
* JSON only; no markdown or extra text.

**EXAMPLE STRUCTURE**

```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "type": "SECTION",
      "title": "Introduction to Document Processing",
      "start_anchor": "Introduction to Document Processing — this paper explores…",
      "end_anchor": "…in summary, this section motivates normalized text offsets.",
      "depth": 0,
      "confidence": 0.95
    },
    {
      "type": "SUBSECTION",
      "title": "Overview of the System",
      "start_anchor": "Overview of the System: the pipeline consists of…",
      "end_anchor": "…these components together enable efficient extraction.",
      "depth": 1,
      "confidence": 0.92
    }
  ]
}
```

**PROFILE GUIDELINES**

* **academic**: Focus on formal structure, chapters, sections, citations, research papers
* **technical**: Emphasize procedures, steps, technical specifications, documentation
* **narrative**: Look for story elements, scenes, dialogue, character development
* **notes**: Focus on bullet points, lists, topic groupings, informal structure
* **article**: Emphasize sections, subsections, paragraphs, journalistic structure
* **general**: Balanced approach suitable for mixed content

**GRANULARITY GUIDELINES**
