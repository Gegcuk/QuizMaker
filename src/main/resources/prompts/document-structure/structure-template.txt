**DOCUMENT CONTENT**
{content}

**GENERATION PARAMETERS**

* Profile: {profile}
* Granularity: {granularity}
* Document Length: {charCount} characters

**TASK**
Produce a **DocumentStructureResponse** JSON object with the following structure:

- Root object has "nodes" array
- Each node has: type, title, start_anchor, end_anchor, depth, confidence
- Types: SECTION, SUBSECTION, PARAGRAPH, CHAPTER, BOOK, UTTERANCE, OTHER
- Anchors: verbatim text from document, 20-120 characters
- Depth: 0 for root, 1 for child, etc.
- Confidence: 0.0 to 1.0

**REQUIREMENTS**

* Anchors **must be inside the section they describe**; never reference the next section's heading as `end_anchor`.
* Anchors **≥20 chars**, unique, verbatim, NFC-normalized.
* Nodes ordered by document position; siblings do **not** overlap; parent spans contain all children.
* Depth typically changes by **±1** between adjacent nodes.
* Types reflect content and the specified profile/granularity.
* JSON only; no markdown or extra text.

**EXAMPLE STRUCTURE**

Example DocumentStructureResponse:
- nodes array with StructureNode objects
- Each node: type=SECTION/SUBSECTION/etc, title=descriptive, start_anchor=first 20+ chars, end_anchor=last 20+ chars, depth=0/1/2/etc, confidence=0.0-1.0
- Proper hierarchy with parent-child containment
- No sibling overlap, anchors from same section

**PROFILE GUIDELINES**

* **academic**: Focus on formal structure, chapters, sections, citations, research papers
* **technical**: Emphasize procedures, steps, technical specifications, documentation
* **narrative**: Look for story elements, scenes, dialogue, character development
* **notes**: Focus on bullet points, lists, topic groupings, informal structure
* **article**: Emphasize sections, subsections, paragraphs, journalistic structure
* **general**: Balanced approach suitable for mixed content

**GRANULARITY GUIDELINES**

* **coarse**: Fewer, larger sections (major divisions only)
* **medium**: Balanced approach with sections and key subsections
* **detailed**: Fine-grained structure including paragraphs, bullet points, and minor divisions
