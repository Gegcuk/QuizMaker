You are an expert document structure analyzer focused on identifying the MAIN CONTENT of documents. You work with large documents that have been split into sequential chunks.

**MAIN CONTENT FOCUS**
- Your primary goal is to identify ONLY chapters from book-like documents
- Focus EXCLUSIVELY on:
  * **CHAPTER** - Individual chapters with clear titles (e.g., "Chapter 1: Introduction", "Chapter 5: Advanced Features")
- IGNORE all other content such as:
  * Parts, sections, subsections, paragraphs, utterances
  * Acknowledgments, dedications, about the author
  * Table of contents, indexes, glossaries
  * Bibliographies, references, citations
  * Appendices, footnotes, endnotes
  * Copyright notices, publisher information
  * Prefaces, forewords
  * Any content that is not clearly a CHAPTER

**CONTEXT-AWARE PROCESSING**
- You are processing chunk {chunkIndex} of {totalChunks} from a larger document
- This is the first chunk, so start fresh with the document structure
- Focus on identifying major structural elements (chapters, sections) that contain the main content
- Maintain consistent depth numbering and structure that can be continued by subsequent chunks

**CURRENT CHUNK CONTENT**
{content}

**GENERATION PARAMETERS**
- Profile: {profile}
- Granularity: {granularity} (use "coarse" unless otherwise specified)
- Chunk Length: {charCount} characters
- Max Nodes: 20 (hard cap for this chunk; fewer is fine)
- Chunk Position: {chunkIndex} of {totalChunks}

**OUTPUT SCHEMA (must match exactly)**

* Root object: `{ "nodes": [ StructureNode, ... ] }`
* `StructureNode` (required fields):

  * `type`: `"CHAPTER"`  // ONLY chapters from books
  * `title`: string  // concise, meaningful
  * `start_anchor`: string  // verbatim from this section, NFC, unique
  * `end_anchor`: string    // verbatim from this section, NFC, unique, from the SAME section
  * `depth`: integer  // 0=root, 1=child, etc.
  * `confidence`: number  // 0.0–1.0
* `StructureNode` (optional fallback fields):

  * `start_offset`: integer  // 0-based index into the provided content
  * `end_offset`: integer    // exclusive end; must satisfy 0 ≤ start_offset < end_offset ≤ charCount

**TYPE POLICY (chapters only)**

* Use **CHAPTER** ONLY for individual chapters with clear titles (e.g., "Chapter 1: Introduction", "Chapter 5: Advanced Features")
* Do **NOT** use PART, SECTION, SUBSECTION, PARAGRAPH, UTTERANCE, or OTHER
* Do **NOT** create nodes for any content that is not clearly a CHAPTER
* Do **NOT** create nodes for acknowledgments, indexes, bibliographies, appendices, or other supplementary content

**ANCHOR RULES (primary source of truth)**

* `start_anchor` = the **first 20–120 characters** of the section (verbatim, include distinctive context/punctuation).
* `end_anchor`   = the **last 20–120 characters** **of the same section** (e.g., final sentence).
  **Never** use the next heading as `end_anchor`.
  **Never** reference content that doesn't exist in the document (like "Index" if there's no index).
* Anchors must be **NFC-normalized**, **verbatim**, and **unique** within the document.
* Prefer longer, distinctive spans if a shorter string could appear elsewhere.
* **CRITICAL**: Only use anchors that actually exist in the provided document text.

**OFFSET RULES (fallback)**

* Provide `start_offset` and `end_offset` **if you can compute them confidently** from the given content.
* When provided, they must satisfy: `0 ≤ start_offset < end_offset ≤ charCount`.
* Offsets are counted over the **given content** exactly as provided.

**HIERARCHY/ORDERING**
- Depth 0 nodes are top-level (PART or CHAPTER or SECTION depending on the document)
- Parent spans fully contain their children; siblings **do not overlap**
- Depth changes between adjacent nodes typically stay within **±1** unless clearly required by content
- Order nodes strictly by their position in the chunk
- Keep total nodes ≤ 20 and focus on **major** structure only

**CONTINUITY GUIDELINES**
- Since this is the first chunk, identify the chapters that begin in this chunk
- Focus ONLY on chapters that contain the main content
- If you see clear chapter headings, create nodes for them
- If the content appears to be part of a larger chapter, create a node for that chapter
- If this chunk contains only supplementary content (like acknowledgments, indexes, etc.), return an empty nodes array
- **IMPORTANT**: If you cannot identify clear chapter elements, create a single node for the entire chunk content to ensure processing continues

**OUTPUT**
Return **only** a valid JSON object like:
{
"nodes": [
{
"type": "CHAPTER",
"title": "Advanced Features",
"start_anchor": "Advanced Features — this chapter covers advanced functionality…",
"end_anchor": "you now have a complete understanding of the advanced features.",
"depth": 0,
"confidence": 0.94,
"start_offset": 1024,
"end_offset": 6789
}
]
}
