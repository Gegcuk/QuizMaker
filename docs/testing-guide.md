# QuizMaker Testing Guide

This guide explains which test style to use, what behavior to prove, and how to keep tests trustworthy. It applies to human contributors and AI agents.

## Choose The Smallest Correct Test

| Concern | Preferred test | What it proves |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pure transformation, validator, parser, calculation, or service rule | JUnit 5 unit test | Business behavior without Spring or MySQL. |
| Controller mapping, validation, HTTP response, security, or `ProblemDetail` | `@WebMvcTest` with MockMvc | The HTTP boundary and serialization contract. |
| Custom JPA query, index-sensitive behavior, mapping, locking, or constraint | `@DataJpaTest` or focused database test | Actual persistence semantics. |
| Transaction, event listener, security chain, migration, async job, or several real layers | Focused integration test | Cross-layer behavior that a unit test cannot prove. |
| Provider protocol or API contract | Fake/stub plus contract/schema test | The boundary without calling a real provider. |

Do not start Spring or MySQL for JSON parsing, schema validation, deterministic scoring, or other pure logic. Conversely, do not mock the database when the behavior being claimed is a JPA query, lock, or database constraint.

## Project Test Environment

The full test suite uses the `test` profile and a MySQL test database. CI starts MySQL and runs Flyway migrations before the suite. Follow the existing profile and base-test conventions in the feature you are changing; do not add ad hoc database setup to individual tests.

Use `BaseIntegrationTest` only when the test genuinely needs the full Spring context. Keep unit and MVC tests independent of application startup.

### Shared MySQL Schema Isolation

The `test` and `test-mysql` profiles share CI MySQL schemas. Some existing Spring tests deliberately use Hibernate `create` or `create-drop`, so the full lifecycle of every Spring TestContext is serialized by `SharedMySqlSchemaLockTestExecutionListener`, registered in `src/test/resources/META-INF/spring.factories`. This prevents one context from dropping tables while another context is starting or executing.

- Plain JUnit and Mockito tests remain eligible for parallel execution. Do not disable JUnit parallelism globally to address a database failure.
- Do not bypass the global listener with `@TestExecutionListeners(mergeMode = REPLACE_DEFAULTS)`. If such replacement is unavoidable, include the shared-schema listener explicitly and document why.
- Use `db-serial` only for tests that require the dedicated serial Surefire lane for their own behavior. Database schema lifecycle isolation is automatic; do not add the tag merely because a Spring test uses MySQL.
- Preserve the existing `@DirtiesContext`, transaction, and cleanup conventions in the test being changed. The listener protects schema lifecycle, not test data that a scenario intentionally commits.

## Unit Tests

Use real input values and narrow collaborator doubles. A unit test should describe a rule in observable terms, for example:

```java
@Test
void calculateSchedule_whenGradeIsAgain_resetsRepetitionAndUsesMinimumEase() {
    // Given
    // When
    // Then
}
```

- Cover the happy path, validation boundary, and important failure semantics.
- Use parameterized tests for a compact matrix of equivalent rules or boundary values.
- Use builders or small factory methods for readable fixture creation; keep fixtures local unless they are genuinely shared.
- Mock only a real collaborator boundary. Do not invent impossible collaborator output merely to reach defensive code.
- Inject a fixed `Clock` rather than using sleeps or timing-sensitive assertions.

## MVC And API Contract Tests

Use `@WebMvcTest` or standalone MockMvc when testing controller behavior.

- Verify status, response DTO shape, validation errors, and relevant `ProblemDetail` fields.
- Include `.with(csrf())` for state-changing routes when CSRF is enabled for that test path.
- Use `@WithMockUser` or the project security test support for protected endpoints.
- Assert negative authorization paths where applicable: unauthenticated, missing permission, wrong owner, wrong organization, and private resource.
- Mock service interfaces, not their implementations. Controller tests are not service tests.

## Repository And Migration Tests

Use a real test database for custom queries and persistence invariants.

- Assert owner/tenant scoping, pagination ordering, soft-delete filtering, and null behavior.
- Test unique constraints, optimistic locking, and migration-backed invariants when they protect data integrity.
- Test fetch plans where an endpoint needs relationships. Avoid claiming that N+1 is fixed without observing the relevant query behavior.
- Prefer deterministic fixtures and explicit ordering. Tests must not depend on execution order or left-over data.

## Integration Tests

Reserve integration tests for behavior that crosses real boundaries: service transactions, `AFTER_COMMIT` listeners, migration wiring, security configuration, serialization, or asynchronous job orchestration.

- Keep each scenario narrow and name the cross-layer contract it verifies.
- For asynchronous behavior, invoke a synchronous seam, use a controlled executor, or wait on a deterministic signal. Do not use arbitrary sleeps.
- Verify idempotency, retries, and rollback/partial-failure behavior where the feature uses them.

## External Systems And AI

Automated tests must never call real OpenAI, Stripe, email, storage, transcription, or other paid/remote services.

- Define project-owned ports/interfaces around providers.
- Use fakes or stubs that model valid provider responses and meaningful failures.
- Validate AI payloads at the structured-client or parser boundary.
- Test the application service only with collaborator output that the real collaborator can validly produce.
- Treat prompts, schemas, examples, and backward-compatible payload variants as contract assets; test them directly when they matter to generation.

## OpenAPI, Compatibility, And Security

For a changed public contract, add focused tests for:

- the endpoint's OpenAPI group and `/api/v1/api-summary` discovery;
- named request/response schemas, examples, enums, and expected RFC 7807 errors;
- request validation and authentication/permission behavior;
- old payloads or persisted data that must remain supported;
- the changed payload or response fields that the frontend relies on.

## Naming And Structure

Use names that identify the use case and observable outcome:

```text
methodOrRoute_whenCondition_thenExpectedOutcome
```

Examples:

```text
createQuiz_whenTitleIsBlank_thenReturnsBadRequest
parseFillGap_whenOptionsAreMissing_thenPreservesLegacyTypingMode
findDueEntries_whenEntryBelongsToAnotherUser_thenDoesNotReturnIt
```

Use Given/When/Then sections where they make a test easier to read. One test may have several assertions when they prove the same outcome.

## Commands

Run the narrowest relevant checks first:

```bash
./mvnw test -Dtest=QuestionServiceImplTest
./mvnw test -Dtest=QuestionControllerTest,QuestionSchemaServiceTest
./mvnw verify
git diff --check
```

Report what ran, what did not run, and any residual risk. A passing test that asserts the wrong thing is not useful coverage.
