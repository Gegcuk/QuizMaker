# QuizMaker Backend

Welcome to **QuizMaker** backend! This Spring Boot application powers a flexible, secure, and future-proof quiz platform
with JSON-based question storage, audit trails, role management, and more.

For a concise overview of the API and example question formats, see [PROJECT_DESCRIPTION.md](PROJECT_DESCRIPTION.md).

## üöÄ Overview

QuizMaker lets you create, manage, and deliver quizzes with ease. On the backend, we:

- Store question definitions in MySQL using the native `JSON` column type for flexibility
- Never expose correct answers to the frontend‚Äîgrading happens securely on the server
- Track every user's answers and quiz results in dedicated tables
- Manage user roles via a many-to-many mapping
- Keep audit logs and soft-delete records for compliance and recovery
- Provide hooks for spaced repetition, analytics, ratings, comments, notifications, and more

_All tables include `is_deleted` + `deleted_at` for soft deletes, plus `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamps for
audit readiness._

## üõ†Ô∏è Running Tests

We use JUnit 5, Mockito, and Testcontainers:

``` 
mvn test  
```

Integration tests will spin up a disposable MySQL container and run through key API flows.

## üîí Security Enhancements (Latest Update)

### Critical Security Fix Applied

- **FIXED**: Questions sent to users during quiz attempts no longer expose correct answers
- **NEW**: `QuestionForAttemptDto` - Safe DTO that strips out all sensitive information
- **NEW**: `SafeQuestionContentBuilder` - Sanitizes question content before sending to users
- **NEW**: Enhanced attempt management with pause/resume functionality

### What was fixed:

- MCQ questions: Removed `"correct": true` flags from options
- TRUE_FALSE questions: Removed `"answer"` field
- FILL_GAP questions: Removed `"answer"` fields from gaps
- OPEN questions: Removed expected `"answer"` field
- COMPLIANCE questions: Removed `"compliant"` flags from statements
- HOTSPOT questions: Removed `"correct"` flags from regions
- ORDERING questions: Shuffled items to prevent pattern recognition

### Security Features:

- ‚úÖ All answer validation happens server-side
- ‚úÖ Questions are sanitized before sending to users
- ‚úÖ Explanations are only shown after attempt completion
- ‚úÖ User ownership validation on all attempt operations
- ‚úÖ Timer enforcement for timed quizzes
- ‚úÖ Suspicious activity flagging

## Enhanced Features

### üìä Analytics & Statistics

- Detailed attempt statistics with timing data
- Question-level performance metrics
- Accuracy and completion percentages
- Individual question timing analysis

### üîß Attempt Management

- Pause and resume functionality for attempts
- Enhanced attempt status tracking (IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED, ABANDONED, PAUSED)
- Shuffled question delivery to prevent cheating
- Better error handling and validation

### üõ°Ô∏è Security & Audit

- Safe question content delivery without answers
- Suspicious activity detection and flagging
- Comprehensive ownership validation
- Enhanced audit capabilities

## API Endpoints

### Safe Question Delivery

```
GET /api/v1/attempts/quizzes/{quizId}/questions/shuffled
```

Returns randomized questions without correct answers.

### Attempt Management

```
POST /api/v1/attempts/{attemptId}/pause    # Pause attempt
POST /api/v1/attempts/{attemptId}/resume   # Resume attempt
GET  /api/v1/attempts/{attemptId}/stats    # Get detailed stats
```

### Secure Answer Submission

```
POST /api/v1/attempts/{attemptId}/answers       # Submit single answer
POST /api/v1/attempts/{attemptId}/answers/batch # Submit multiple answers
```

## Safe JSON Examples

### MCQ Question (Safe for Users)

```json
{
  "id": "3fa85f64-5717-4562-b3fc-2c963f66afa6",
  "type": "MCQ_SINGLE",
  "questionText": "Which is correct Java syntax?",
  "safeContent": {
    "options": [
      {"id": "opt1", "text": "int x = 5;"},
      {"id": "opt2", "text": "int x := 5;"}
    ]
  },
  "hint": "Think about variable declaration"
}
```

### TRUE/FALSE Question (Safe for Users)

```json
{
  "id": "3fa85f64-5717-4562-b3fc-2c963f66afa6",
  "type": "TRUE_FALSE",
  "questionText": "Java is object-oriented.",
  "safeContent": {},
  "hint": "Consider Java's paradigm"
}
```

## Architecture

The application now uses a dual-DTO approach:

- `QuestionDto` - Full question data for admins/management
- `QuestionForAttemptDto` - Safe question data for users taking quizzes

This ensures that sensitive information like correct answers, explanations, and metadata are never exposed to users
during active quiz attempts.

## Running the Application

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

## Testing

All security fixes have been applied with comprehensive test coverage to ensure:

- Correct answers are never exposed in API responses
- Answer validation works correctly on the backend
- User ownership is properly enforced
- Timing constraints are respected
